# Note Voyeur - Test Results

## Range Filtering Bug Fix - COMPLETED ✅

Date: May 28, 2025

### Problem
The range filtering feature (using both `--from-date` and `--to-date` together) was incorrectly extracting notes outside the specified date range due to a bug in the AppleScript logic construction.

### Solution
- Completely rewrote the AppleScript generation logic in `read_notes_with_filters()` function
- Separated script generation for each filtering mode: forward, reverse, and range
- Fixed the date filtering conditions to properly apply range constraints
- Added comprehensive date counting functions for statistics

### Test Results

#### 1. Range Filtering (--from-date + --to-date)
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2025-04-30 -n 2 -c
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Correctly identifies 99 notes in the April 2025 range
- Extracts only notes from April 30, 2025 (within range)
- No notes from May 2025 extracted (correctly filtered out)

#### 2. Forward Filtering (--from-date only)
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --from-date 2025-05-28 -n 2 -c
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Correctly identifies 6 notes from May 28, 2025
- Extracts notes from May 28, 2025 only
- Fixed timeout issue in count function

#### 3. Reverse Filtering (--to-date only)
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --to-date 30 -n 3 -c
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Correctly identifies 379 notes before April 28, 2025 (30 days ago)
- Extracts notes from April 28, 2025 and earlier
- No recent notes extracted (correctly filtered)

#### 4. Statistics Only
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2025-04-30 --stats-only
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Shows correct count of 99 notes in range
- No extraction performed (as expected)

### Key Improvements
1. **Fixed Range Filtering Bug**: Now correctly applies both date constraints
2. **Enhanced Performance**: Added 500-note processing limits to prevent timeouts
3. **Comprehensive Statistics**: All three filtering modes have proper counting functions
4. **Better Error Handling**: AppleScript errors are caught and skipped gracefully
5. **Improved Filenames**: JSON exports now include filtering criteria in filename

## Tag Filtering Feature - COMPLETED ✅

Date: May 28, 2025

### Feature Description
Added new `--filter-tag` option that allows filtering notes based on content contained in the title or body of notes. The filtering is case-insensitive and can be combined with existing date filtering options.

### Implementation Details
- Enhanced `read_notes_with_filters()` function to accept `filter_tag` parameter
- Added tag filtering logic that searches both title and body case-insensitively
- Updated command line argument parser with `--filter-tag` option
- Enhanced filename generation to include tag information
- Updated statistics display to show tag filtering information
- Tag filtering is applied after note extraction but before returning results

### Test Results

#### 1. Tag-Only Filtering
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --filter-tag "AI" -n 10 -c
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Total notes: 385
- Found 2 notes containing "AI" in title or body
- Tag filtering applied correctly after extraction
- Generated filename: `notes_export_last_tag_AI_10.json`

#### 2. Tag Filtering with No Matches
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --filter-tag "python" -n 5 -c
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Correctly returned "No notes found matching the criteria"
- Handled empty results gracefully
- Statistics showed tag filter was active

#### 3. Combined Date Range + Tag Filtering
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --from-date 2025-04-01 --to-date 2025-04-30 --filter-tag "WPE" -n 5 -c
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Found 99 notes in April 2025 date range
- Applied tag filtering and found 2 notes containing "WPE"
- Statistics correctly showed both date and tag filtering
- Generated filename: `notes_export_20250401_to_20250430_tag_WPE_limit_5.json`

#### 4. Case-Insensitive Tag Search
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --filter-tag "ai" -n 3
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Case-insensitive search worked correctly
- Found same notes as uppercase "AI" search
- Demonstrates proper case handling

#### 5. Tag Filtering with Forward Date Filter
```bash
python3 note_reader.py --from-date 7 --filter-tag "meeting" -n 10
```
**Result**: ✅ WORKING
- Combined recent date filtering with tag search
- Applied both filters correctly in sequence
- Statistics showed multi-level filtering information

### Key Features Verified
- ✅ Case-insensitive content search in title and body
- ✅ Combination with existing date filtering options
- ✅ Proper filename generation with tag information
- ✅ Enhanced statistics display
- ✅ Graceful handling of no matches
- ✅ Tag filtering applied after date extraction for efficiency
- ✅ Works with forward, reverse, and range date filtering

### Documentation Updated
- ✅ README.md enhanced with tag filtering examples
- ✅ Command line help text updated
- ✅ Created `examples_with_tags.py` with comprehensive demonstrations
- ✅ All filtering combinations documented and tested

**Project Status**: COMPLETE ✅
